<h2>
Description
</h2>
You are to write an assembler for the Stack Machine.
The behavioral characteristics of the stack machine
are described in the document
<a href="http://cs.potsdam.edu/Classes/463/Notes/assembler-doc.html">assembler-doc</a>.
That document also explains the mnemonics for the stack
machine opcodes and broadly describes the features
the stack machine assembler provides.
<p>
Input to the stack machine assembler should be a text file
containing lines of the following format:
</p><blockquote><pre>[ label [:]] [ operation [ operand ] ] [ ;comment ]
</pre></blockquote>
The items
<samp>label</samp>,
<samp>operation</samp>,
<samp>operand</samp>,
and <samp>;comment</samp>
are called <em>fields</em>.
An item enclosed in brackets is optional.
As a consequence,
a blank line is a legal assembler line.
Any combination of spaces and/or tabs
(<em>whitespace</em>)
may be used to separate the fields of a line;
it is not necessary that whitespace precede a colon or semicolon.
Each line must be terminated with a standard end-of-line mark.
<p>
An <em>operation</em> may be any
of the stack machine opcode mnemonics,
plus the following <em>assembler directives</em>:
</p><blockquote><pre>DS	DW	EQU	ENTRY	EXTERN	PUBLIC
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Stack machine opcodes always generate executable code
(an opcode, possibly followed by an operand value),
while assembler directives are intended
to direct assembler activities
and do not in general generate executable code.
Together, the opcode mnemonics and directives
are reserved words.
Reserved words may appear in uppercase, lowercase,
or any mixture of cases.
</p><p>
A <em>label</em> is any sequence of letters, digits, dots, and underscores,
beginning with a letter or at-sign '@' character,
but excluding reserved words.
A label is also called an <em>identifier</em>.
Labels longer than 30 characters in length are
silently truncated to 30 characters.
</p><p>
Labels that differ in case are considered to be different,
so that <samp>XYZ</samp> and <samp>xyz</samp> are considered different labels.
</p><p>
A label beginning with an at-sign '@' character
identifies it as a "local label".
Internally, local labels are prepended with the most recently encountered
non-local label definition (which defines the 'scope' of the local label)
for the purpose of putting them in the symbol table
and are otherwise treated as ordinary labels.
This allows for defining simple labels within small code blocks
(beginning with the definition of a non-local label)
that do not conflict with the same local label names
in other code blocks.
Note that a non-local label defined
in an <samp>EQU</samp> directive
is <em>not</em> considered defining a new local label scope.
</p><p>
The start of an assembly language program is considered as beginning
with an empty non-local label name.
Local labels cannot be declared
as <samp>ENTRY</samp>, <samp>PUBLIC</samp>, or <samp>EXTERN</samp>,
although a non-local label can be <samp>EQU</samp>d to a local label
and the non-local label then can be declared
as <samp>PUBLIC</samp> or <samp>ENTRY</samp>.
Moreover,
an <samp>ENTRY</samp>,
<samp>PUBLIC</samp>,
or <samp>EXTERN</samp> label declaration
does not define a new local label scope.
</p><p>
If a label is the first item on an input line
and is followed by a colon ':',
the assembler associates with it a value
equal to the current location counter
at the beginning of the line.
If the label is followed by the <samp>EQU</samp> directive,
the assembler associates with it a value equal
to the operand expression that follows the <samp>EQU</samp> directive.
In either case, the label is said to be <em>defined</em>
when it appears as the first field on an input line,
and such a label is said to be in <em>label position</em>.
It is an error <em>(multiply defined label)</em>
for a label to appear
more than once in label position.
</p><p>
If an undefined label appears in an operand expression,
the entire expression evaluates to an undefined value.
Except for expressions in <samp>DS</samp> directives,
undefined values in pass 1
will not result in an assembly error.
In pass 2, the value of an operand expression that is undefined
will not result in an assembly error
unless the value is used
to create an entry in the object module.
</p><p>
A label at the beginning of a line
<em>must</em> be followed by a colon ':'
except in the case of an <samp>EQU</samp> directive,
in which case it <em>must not</em>
be followed by a colon.
</p><p>
Operands may be ordinary algebraic expressions
including the arithmetic operations of
addition (<code>+</code>),
subtraction (<code>-</code>),
multiplication (<code>*</code>),
division (<code>/</code>),
and modulus (<code>%</code>).
Unary minus (<code>-</code>) is also allowed.
An operand within an expression may be either
a label,
the '<code>$</code>' symbol,
an (unsigned) integer constant,
or a character constant.
Parentheses may be used to alter
the normal arithmetic precedence rules.
</p><p>
Operands to multiplication, division, and modulus
must be absolute, and the result is absolute.
Operands to addition, subtraction, and unary minus
may be absolute or relocatable.
The result will be absolute or relocatable,
depending on the absolute or relocatable attributes of its operands.

</p><p>
The value of a label in an expression
is the value associated with the label at the time
the expression is evaluated.
A label's value may be either
<em>absolute</em>
or <em>relocatable</em>,
depending on how the label is defined.
A label may also be <em>external</em>
(if defined in a <samp>EXTERN</samp> directive),
in which case it is implicitly absolute.
</p><p>
The only permissible expressions involving <samp>EXTERN</samp> labels
are
<tt>EXTERN</tt>,
<tt>EXTERN+abs</tt>,
and <tt>EXTERN-abs</tt>.
Internally, the assembler treats an <samp>EXTERN</samp> label
as having an absolute value of zero
for the purposes of generating object module code.
Locations in the object module corresponding
to an expression generated from an <samp>EXTERN</samp> label
will be flagged in the object module in an <samp>EXTERN</samp> label entry
and will be fixed up upon linking the module with another object module
that has defined the label as <samp>PUBLIC</samp>.
An <samp>EXTERN</samp> label cannot be declared
as <samp>PUBLIC</samp> in the same source code.
</p><p>
The value of the special symbol '<code>$</code>' in an
expression is the value of the location counter
<em>at the beginning of the line in which the expression occurs</em>.
This value is always relocatable.
</p><p>
An <em>integer constant</em> is a sequence
of decimal digits '0', '1', ... '9' representing a decimal number.
This number should not exceed the range of possible 32-bit signed integers,
i.e., -2147483648 to 2147483647.
(Your assembler is not required to check for this.)
An integer constant is always absolute.
An integer constant beginning with the digit '0' and followed
by one or more octal digits
(the digits '0' through '7')
represents an octal number.
An integer constant beginning with the digit '0',
followed by either the letter 'x' or 'X',
and followed by one or more hexadecimal digits
(the digits '0' through '9' and the letters 'A' through 'F'
in either upper or lower case)
represents a hexadecimal number.
</p><p>
A character constant is any printable ASCII character
(with ASCII values from 32 to 126 inclusive)
preceded by a single quote mark;
for example, <code>'F</code> evaluates to the constant 70
and <code>' </code> (quote followed by a space) evaluates to the constant 32.
The single quote character itself is represented as <code>''</code>.
A character constant is treated exactly the same
as its corresponding integer ASCII value,
and can occur wherever an integer constant is permitted.
A character constant is always absolute.
</p><p>
As an illustration of an expression,
if the label <code>LBL</code> is relocatable and has value 2
and the location counter is 5,
then the expression
</p><blockquote><pre>($-LBL)*'F
</pre></blockquote>
evaluates to absolute 210.
<p>
If a label in an operand expression is undefined
at the time the expression is evaluated,
the entire expression is considered undefined.
In pass one, undefined expressions which are syntactically correct
should not cause an error, except in <samp>DS</samp> directives,
where the expression must evaluate to an absolute non-negative value.
In pass two, undefined expressions always cause an error
if they are operand expressions that generate object module code.
Also at the end of pass two,
labels that appear in <samp>PUBLIC</samp> or <samp>ENTRY</samp> declarations
must have associated values that are defined and relocatable.
</p><p>
The location counter is initialized
to zero when assembly begins.
Each assembled instruction increments
the location counter by the number of words
required to form the instruction;
instruction operations that require one operand
increment the location counter by two,
while instruction operations that require no
operands increment the location counter by one. 
The value of the location counter is always considered relocatable.
</p><p>
The <samp>DS</samp> directive increments the location counter
by the value of the operand expression.
The operand expression must be defined
in pass one of the assembler,
must be non-negative,
and must evaluate to an absolute--not relocatable--value.
</p><p>
The <samp>DW</samp> directive increments the location counter
by one for each word required
to store the <em>operand list</em> that follows the directive.
The operand list has the form
</p><blockquote><pre>expr [ , expr ]*
</pre></blockquote>
where <code>expr</code> is an expression as defined above,
or a string of printable characters enclosed in double quotes (").
<p>
In a string,
the double quote character itself may be represented
in a string if it is preceded by the escape character (\).
Other standard escape sequences are also allowed in strings,
as described below.
While an escape sequence occupies two characters in the source string,
the corresponding character in the token string that is used
to generate operand words in the object module
will consist of a single character value.
</p><p>
The following escape sequences should be recognized in a string:
backspace (\b),
tab (\t),
newline (\n),
formfeed (\f),
return (\r),
single quote (\'),
double quote (\"),
and the escape character itself (\\).
The following table gives the character values
of escape sequences that may appear in a string
and that produce non-printing characters
in the corresponding token string:
<table border="1" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td>\b</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>\t</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>\n</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>\f</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>\r</td><td>13</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
Quoted strings may not cross line boundaries.
</p><p>
The <samp>DW</samp> directive with a quoted string
is identical to the <em>exploded</em> string obtained
by replacing each character in the string
with its ASCII character equivalent.
for example, the directive
</p><blockquote><pre> 	DW	"this is a string\n"
</pre></blockquote>
is equivalent to the directive
<blockquote><pre> 	DW	't,'h,'i,'s,' ,'i,'s,' ,'a,' ,'s,'t,'r,'i,'n,'g,10
</pre></blockquote>
or even to the directive
<blockquote><pre> 	DW	116,104,105,115,32,105,115,32,97,32,115,116,114,105,110,103,10
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Characters in a token string are deposited in the object module
one character to a word, using the standard ASCII codes,
in the order that they appear in the string.
Successive values are stored
in successively higher memory locations.
There is no distinction between
a string consisting of one character
and the ASCII code for the character itself,
so that "F" and 'F in a <samp>DW</samp> directive result
in exactly the same allocation of storage.
Similarly, "\n" and 10 result
in exactly the same allocation of storage.
The assembler does not insert a null character
in the object module
following the last character of a string.
</p><p>
Expressions used in <samp>DW</samp> directives
may be undefined in pass one of the assembler,
but must be defined in pass two.
Expressions may evaluate to absolute or relocatable values.
A quoted string and character constants are always stored
as absolute (non-relocatable) ASCII values.
</p><p>
The <samp>EQU</samp> directive assigns the value of the operand expression
to the associated label.
A label must be present on an <samp>EQU</samp> directive line
and must not be followed by a colon;
in all other cases a label is optional.
The value of the operand expression in an <samp>EQU</samp> directive
may be undefined in pass one of the assembler,
but must be defined (absolute, relocatable, or Extern) in pass two
unless that label does not appear
in any operand expressions that generate object module code
or in any <samp>PUBLIC</samp> or <samp>ENTRY</samp> directive.
</p><p>
The <samp>EXTERN</samp> directive is followed
by one or more non-local labels separated by commas.
This directive declares the indicated labels
as being defined in another module
but used in this module.
It is an error for an identifier
to be both declared Extern and to appear in label position.
</p><p>
The <samp>PUBLIC</samp> directive is followed
by one or more non-local labels separated by commas.
This directive marks the indicated labels
as being defined in this module
and accessible in other modules
through an <samp>EXTERN</samp> directive in those modules.
All <samp>PUBLIC</samp> labels must be defined and relocatable
at the end of pass 2.
</p><p>
The <samp>ENTRY</samp> directive is followed
by one non-local label.
This directive marks the indicated label
as the entry point of any executable program
linked with this module.
An <samp>ENTRY</samp> label must be defined and relocatable
at the end of pass 2.
</p><p>
A comment begins with a semicolon (<code>;</code>)
and continues to the end of the line.
Comments are not tokens.
They are ignored
for the purposes of generating object code,
and they do not affect the location counter.
A semicolon inside of a quoted string
or in a character expression (';) is not considered
as the beginning of a comment.
</p><p>
There should be a predefined label '<code>SP</code>'
with a predefined value of 0 (absolute),
as if there were a line
</p><blockquote><pre>SP	EQU	0
</pre></blockquote>
at the beginning of every source code program.
The lexical analyzer should consider all upper/lower case combinations
of ''SP'' to be equivalent to the single token <code>SP</code>.
This label may be used in expressions,
but should be included in the cross-reference list
<em>if and only if</em> it appears in the body of your program.
<p>
Output from the assembler is a text file
in stack machine object module format
as illustrated below and described in the next section.
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table border="1" align="center">
<tbody><tr><td align="left">%SXX+Object Module
</td></tr><tr><td align="left">text_length
</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% text
</td></tr><tr><td align="center">...
</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% relocation dictionary
</td></tr><tr><td align="center">...
</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% ENTRY, EXTERN, and PUBLIC declarations
</td></tr><tr><td align="center">...
</td></tr><tr><td align="left">% end of object module
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>
<h3>Object Module Format</h3>
<p>
The format of an object module appears as follows:
</p><blockquote><pre>%SXX+Object
text_length
% text
...
% relocation dictionary
...
% ENTRY, EXTERN, and PUBLIC declarations
...
% end of object module
</pre></blockquote>
On lines beginning with a <code>%</code>,
any characters may appear following the <code>%</code> on the line.
<p>
Text and relocation dictionary lines
in the object module contain a single integer
optionally preceded by whitespace
and followed (preceded by whitespace) by any text
up to end-of-line.
The integer represents a data value
or stack machine instruction.
A line in the <em>text</em> portion
of the object module may also consist of <samp>DS</samp> entry --
a colon '<code>:</code>' followed by a single integer,
which has the effect of adding the integer value
to the current location counter.
This is useful for processing <samp>DS</samp> directives.
</p><p>
The <em>text_length</em> is the number of stack machine words determined
by the <em>text</em> portion of the object module,
adjusted appropriately for <samp>DS</samp> entries. 
The <em>relocation dictionary</em> contains the addresses of all
object module words that are relocatable
and is used when linking the object module
to produce a Stack Machine executable.
</p><p>
An <samp>ENTRY</samp> line has the format
</p><blockquote><pre>ENTRY label addr
</pre></blockquote>
where <code>label</code> is the name of the entry point
and <code>addr</code> is the code address in the object module
which should begin execution when the module is linked and run.
There can be at most one <samp>ENTRY</samp> line in an object module.
<p>
A <samp>PUBLIC</samp> line has the format
</p><blockquote><pre>PUBLIC label addr
</pre></blockquote>
where <code>label</code> is the name of the exported label
and <code>addr</code> is its exported value
(represented as a decimal integer).
There can be zero or more <samp>PUBLIC</samp> lines in an object module.
<p>
An <samp>EXTERN</samp> line has the format
</p><blockquote><pre>EXTERN label addr addr...
</pre></blockquote>
where <code>label</code> is the name of the imported label
and <code>addr ...</code> are whitespace-separated addresses
(represented as decimal integers)
where the symbol is referenced.
There may be zero or more <samp>EXTERN</samp> lines in an object module.
<p>
The assembler is invoked using the '<samp>sax</samp>' command,
suggesting the 'Stack machine Assembler eXtended'.
The format of the command line is
</p><blockquote><pre>sax [-o ofile] [-l lfile] file
</pre></blockquote>
If the optional '<samp>-o ofile</samp>' arguments are given,
the object module is deposited
in the file '<samp>ofile</samp>';
otherwise the object module is sent to the standard output.
If the optional '<samp>-l lfile</samp>' arguments are given,
a listing of the assembled
file is deposited in the file '<samp>lfile</samp>';
otherwise no listing file will be produced.
The '<samp>file</samp>' argument must correspond to a text file
in the assembly language format described above. 
<p>
</p><h3>
Listing File Format
</h3>
<p>
The listing file should have
the format described in the following example:
</p><blockquote><pre> Line        LC Op     Operand	Source Line
 ----        -- --     -------	-----------
    1:        0             15  A       EQU     15
    2:        0              6R B       EQU     str + 3
    3:        0  2           6R START:  PUSHV   B
    4:        2 26                      HALT
    5:        3             65  str:    DW      "ABC",$
              4             66  
              5             67  
              6              3R 
    6:        7                 ; this is a comment
    7:        7            100  @1:     DS      100
  EOF:      107


Cross Reference List
--------------------
Symbol                                 Value   Line Numbers
------                                 -----   ------------
A                                         15 |     1*

@1                                         7R|     7*
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The cross-reference list should be in alphabetical order by label,
with the line number where the label is defined
followed by an asterisk (<code>*</code>).
All local labels associated with a preceding non-local label
should appear in the cross-reference list following the non-local label,
in alphabetical order by label.
</p><p>
In the cross-reference list, 
there should be no more than 80 characters per line;
line numbers that do not fit on an 80 character line
should wrap to the following line,
aligned with the ones on the previous line.
</p><p>
The object code produced by this program appears as follows:
</p><blockquote><pre>%SXX+Object Module
107
% text
2
6
26
65
66
67
3
:100
% relocation dictionary
1
6
% ENTRY, EXTERN, and PUBLIC declarations
% end of object module
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
A line of an object module beginning with the '#' character
is considered a comment and is ignored by the linker.
The first and last lines of an object module must not be comments.
</p><h2>
Lexical Analysis
</h2>
<p>
The lexical structure for the assembler
is similar to that of Pascal,
except that:
</p><ul>
<li>
whitespace consists only of tabs and spaces --
except for quoted strings and single-character constants,
tokens cannot contain whitespace;
</li><li>
comments are considered the same as whitespace --
they are not returned as tokens
</li><li>
there are different keywords as described below;
</li><li>
strings are enclosed in double quotes;
</li></ul>
<p>
The following tokens should be recognized:
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>
Keywords, i.e., all opcode mnemonics
given in <a href="http://cs.potsdam.edu/Classes/463/Notes/assembler-doc.html">assembler-doc</a>
as well as the
<samp>DS</samp>,
<samp>DW</samp>,
<samp>EQU</samp>,
<samp>ENTRY</samp>,
<samp>EXTERN</samp>,
and <samp>PUBLIC</samp> 
directives.
<p></p></li><li>
The following special symbols:
<blockquote><pre>+  -  *  /  %  $  ,  (  )  :
</pre></blockquote>
<p></p></li><li>
Label:
any character string consisting of letters, digits
and underscores (<code>_</code>),
beginning with a letter or at-sign '@'.
Only the first 32 characters of a label are significant.
<p></p></li><li>
Unsigned integer:
any integer in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal format.
<p></p></li><li>
Single-character constant:
any printable character preceded by a single quote (').
<p></p></li><li>
Quoted string:
any sequence of printable ASCII
characters enclosed in double quotes (")
Quoted strings may not cross a line boundary.
A double quote inside a quoted
string is escaped using a backslash (<code>\</code>).
Other escape sequences should be supported
as described above.
<p></p></li><li>
End-of-line, represented by a newline character. 
<p></p></li><li>
End-of-file.
<p></p></li><li>
Error:
any character not considered above.
<p>
Comments,
beginning with a semicolon (<code>;</code>) and continuing to end-of-line
are to be considered the same as whitespace,
and should not be returned as tokens.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p><h2>
Method
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Write your finite state machine code and
test your <code>TokenReader</code> on 
sample assembly-language files
to be sure that it functions properly
and returns the proper token values.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Use the returned values from your <code>TokenReader</code>
to check each input line for
syntax correctness.
Use a finite state machine that recognizes proper syntax;
processing operand expressions will be done
using a finite state expression recognizer discussed in class.
Do not attempt to produce output code
at this point.
<p>
Test your routines carefully to ensure that you can
detect all possible syntax errors.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
Write code to do the above step twice,
carrying out a two-pass scan of
the input file.
Your results on the second pass should be the same
as on the first pass.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Rewrite the first pass of your assembler
to enter labels into the symbol table:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
When you encounter a label at the beginning of a line
(either with a colon or as part of an <samp>EQU</samp> directive):
<ul>
<li>
if it is already in the symbol table,
report a "multiply defined label" error;
</li><li>
if it is not in the symbol table,
insert it in the symbol table
and give it an <code>UNDEF</code> value;
</li></ul>
</li><li>
When you encounter a label following an <samp>EXTERN</samp> directive,
insert it in the symbol table
and initialize it to an <code>UNDEF</code> value;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
Implement operand expression evaluation;
for labels, temporarily assume they have zero values
with a tag value of zero.
In expressions,
have the '<code>$</code>' symbol temporarily evaluate to
zero with a tag value of one.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Rewrite the first and second passes of your assembler
so that the labels are assigned values
and the location counter is properly updated
as the lines are scanned.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Rewrite the operand expression code to
use the 'real' values of labels and the '<code>$</code>' symbol.
</li><li>
The '<code>$</code>' symbol should evaluate
to the value of the location counter at the beginning of the line,
with a tag value of one.
</li><li>
For a label which is the target of an <samp>EQU</samp> directive,
evaluate the operand expression
and deposit the resulting value in the symbol table
corresponding to the label
along with its associated tag.
Note that the expression evaluator
automatically determines the tag of the expression.
(If this is pass two
and the label was already defined in pass 1,
this step is redundant,
but you might check that the value in pass two
is the <em>same</em> as on pass one in this case.)
</li><li>
For labels defined at the beginning of a line
followed by a colon (i.e., not as <samp>EQU</samp> targets),
deposit the value of the location counter
in the symbol table corresponding to the label,
and mark the label as <code>REL</code>.
</li><li>
For labels that appear in an <samp>EXTERN</samp> directive,
deposit an <code>Extern</code> value in the symbol table
corresponding to the label.
Use the first form of the <code>Extern</code> constructor.
</li><li>
Increment the location counter by one for each instruction,
and by one for each operand, if there is one.
For a <samp>DW</samp> directive,
increment the location counter for each value
in the comma-separated list or,
in the case of <code>STRING</code>s,
by one for each character in the string.
For a <samp>DS</samp> directive,
increment the location counter by the value of the operand
(which must have a nonnegative value
with an <code>ABS</code> tag).
Other assembly language lines do not change the location counter.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
Collect the values of the relocation dictionary
during pass two,
according to the locations of any object module values
that are relocatable.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Produce the object module during the second pass of the assembler,
including the relocation dictionary.
Remember that the value of the location counter
at the end of pass one is the same as the text length
that gets output at the beginning of the object module
in pass two.
<p>
Test the code you produce using the sxx emulator.
You can do an assembly and execute in one Unix line as follows:
</p><blockquote><pre>java Sax file | sxxl | sxx
</pre></blockquote>
which pipes the object module output
of your <samp>Sax</samp> assembler into the
<samp>sxxl</samp> linker and then onto the <samp>sxx</samp> emulator.
<p>
If you prefer,
you can create separate object and executable files
using the assembler and linker as follows:
</p><blockquote><pre>java Sax file &gt; file.out
sxxl file.out &gt; file.sxx
sxx file.sxx
</pre></blockquote>
In this example,
<samp>file</samp> is the source file,
<samp>file.out</samp> is the object file produced
by the assembler,
and <samp>file.sxx</samp> is the executable file
generated by the linker.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Implement and test the
<samp>ENTRY</samp>,
<samp>EXTERN</samp>, and
<samp>PUBLIC</samp>
directives,
producing appropriate object module entries.
<p>
</p></li><li>
Implement local labels.
These are labels that begin with an <code>@</code> character.
Local labels are prepended with the most recently encountered
non-local label for the purpose of putting them in the symbol table
and are otherwise treated as ordinary labels.
Local labels cannot be marked <samp>PUBLIC</samp>,
<samp>EXTERN</samp>, or <samp>ENTRY</samp>
(although a non-local label can be marked <samp>PUBLIC</samp>
or <samp>ENTRY</samp>
and <samp>EQU</samp>d to a local label).
</li></ul>
<h2>
Cautions
</h2>
<p>
Some expressions will not be defined until pass two,
so you will need to re-evaluate expressions in pass two.
If an expression value is required
(e.g., to produce object module output)
in pass two and is undefined,
you should regard this as an error.
On the other hand,
it's OK for a label to remain undefined even in pass two
if it doesn't appear in an operand expression
that produces object module output.
</p><p>
Remember that <samp>DS</samp> directives
<em>must</em> have an absolute argument that is
defined and non-negative in pass one.
</p><p>
The relocation dictionary must include all addresses (zero-based) that
contain relocatable values.
These include targets of branches as well
as operand expressions that evaluate to relocatable values.
</p><p>
You do not need to check for expression overflow
or for overflow of unsigned integer constants.
Caveat emptor!
</p><p>
You do not need to check for object module overflow —
i.e., a text length that exceeds the size of the stack machine.
This will be handled by the execution engine.
</p><p>
Uninitialized storage (using the <samp>DS</samp> directive)
can be handled by using the colon-integer feature
of the object module described above.
</p><h2>
Submission
</h2>
<p>
Create an archive of the material you want to submit
in a file named <code>Assembler.tar</code>.
Do not include anything that is not pertinent to your assembler,
but be sure to include test files, documentation, etc.
I should be able to compile your source files
using the <code>/home/student/Classes/463</code> class path.
